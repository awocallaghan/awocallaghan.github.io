# Project summary

For completion of the award of an Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) equivalent AS Level in 2014 I created a map of crime in London in 2013. The data is visualised on a map using [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) and stored using [Google Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en).

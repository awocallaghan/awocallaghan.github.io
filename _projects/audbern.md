## Project summary

**Audbern Ltd** is a ground buying company that needed a new website developed in 2013. I was approached to complete the project of designing and implementing a brochure-style website for the business. The website had key requirements outlined by the client such as an image slider, embedded Twitter feed widget, and a lightweight backend CMS.

## Implementation

I designed and implemented a simple website layout using HTML/CSS. I used the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) JavaScript library and [Unslider](http://unslider.com/) to power the image slider. I used [WolfCMS](https://www.wolfcms.org/) for a lightweight backend PHP panel.

The website files were upload using FTP to the client's web server.

## Final product

You can view the final website live [here](http://audbern.co.uk).

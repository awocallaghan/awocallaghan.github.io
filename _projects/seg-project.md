## Project summary

**Software Engineering Group Project** is a module I completed as part of my BSc Computer Science degree at [University of Southampton](https://southampton.ac.uk). The assessment involved working as a software development team to design and implement a Java application to meet our clients' precise requirements. The design and implementation process involved using AGILE development techniques such as sprints, scrums, and test driven development (TDD). User personas and scenarios were created and linked to tasks required to complete the development of the application.

I created user scenarios linked to automated unit tests using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) to track the progress of our implementation. The application uses the Java Swing library to create a GUI that automates the process of marking XML transcripts. Implementation involved creating a custom XML parser class and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) UI design pattern to ensure a maintainable codebase.

The final application was delivered on time and to the clients' requirements. This project gave me valuable experience of developing a product to a clients' requirements as a team helping prepare me for a software development career.

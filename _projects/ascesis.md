# About

I worked as a web developer for digital marketing agency [Ascesis Media](http://ascesismedia.com/) during the summer break of the second part of my Computer Science degree. I lead the development of two Wordpress-based projects ensuring that they were delivered on schedule to the clients' high expectations and bespoke requirements. Furthermore, I assisted with the maintenance and support of multiple Wordpress websites supporting my colleagues whenever possible.

This employment added to my real world experience of developing websites, working as a team, and ensuring my work is of the best standard.

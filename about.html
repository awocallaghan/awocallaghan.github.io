    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Alex O'Callaghan and I'm a web developer from London, England. This is my personal website created to publish blog
      posts and projects as I develop my programming skills and create new tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in all areas of software development with a particular interest
      in web development. I completed <em>BSc Computer Science</em> at the <a href="https://southampton.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Southampton</a> giving me a strong understanding of
      <strong>Object Orientated Programming</strong> using <strong>Java</strong> and
      exposed me to <strong>Functional Programming Languages</strong> such as
      <strong>Scheme</strong> and <strong>OCaml</strong>. Furthermore I have a firm
      grasp of fundamental Computer Science concepts such as algorithmic complexity,
      computability and data structures. For my final year project I designed and implemented a video analytics web application for university lecturers using <strong>Vue.js</strong> + <strong>Data-Driven Documents (D3)</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>RethinkDB</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I have delved into web development experimenting with
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> front end frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>,
      <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Vue.js</strong>.
      I've created
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~awocallaghan" target="_blank">npm packages</a>
      contributing to the open source JavaScript community and familiarised myself
      with best practices and useful build tools such as <strong>Gulp</strong>,
      <strong>Grunt</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>,  and <strong>Browserify</strong>. In addition, I'm experienced with a range of server-side languages including <strong>JavaScript (Node.js)</strong>, <strong>PHP (Laravel, WordPress)</strong>, <strong>Java (Spring)</strong>, and <strong>C# (ASP.NET)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a strong understanding of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>.
      I've used CSS preprocessors such as <strong>SASS</strong> and <strong>LESS</strong>
      and popular frameworks such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Foundation</strong>
      to create responsive websites. I've completed freelance web development work
      designing and implementing professional websites to clients' requirements.
      I've employed the iterative Agile software development methodology of conducting
      scrums and sprints to burn through the project backlog when working as a software development team. Furthermore, I understand
      the importance of following <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong>
      and <strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong> to ensure a project
      meets all functional and user experience requirements.

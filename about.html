    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Alex O'Callaghan and I'm currently studying Computer Science at
      Southampton University. This is my personal website created to publish blog
      posts and projects as I develop my programming skills and create new tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in all areas of software development with a particular interest
      in web development. My University degree has given me a strong understanding of
      <strong>Object Orientated Programming</strong> using <strong>Java</strong> and
      exposed me to <strong>Functional Programming Languages</strong> such as
      <strong>Scheme</strong> and <strong>OCaml</strong>. Furthermore I have a firm
      grasp of fundamental Computer Science concepts such as algorithmic complexity,
      computability and data structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my free time I have delved into web development experimenting with
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>,
      <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>.
      I've created
      <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~awocallaghan" target="_blank">npm packages</a>
      contributing to the open source JavaScript community and familiarised myself
      with best practices and useful build tools such as <strong>Gulp</strong>,
      <strong>Grunt</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>, <strong>Browserify</strong>, etc. In addition, I'm experienced with a range of server-side languages including JavaScript (Node.js), PHP (Laravel, WordPress), Java (Spring), and C# (ASP.NET).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a strong understanding of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>.
      I've used CSS preprocessors such as <strong>SASS</strong> and <strong>LESS</strong>
      and popular frameworks such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Foundation</strong>
      to create responsive websites. I've completed freelance web development work
      designing and implementing professional websites to clients' requirements.
      I've employed the iterative Agile software development methodology of conducting
      scrums and sprints to burn through the project backlog. Furthermore, I understand
      the importance of following <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong>
      and <strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong> to ensure a project
      meets all functional and user experience requirements.

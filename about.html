<h3>About me</h3>

<p>
  My name is Alex O'Callaghan and I'm currently studying Computer Science at
  Southampton University. This is my personal website created to publish blog
  posts and projects as I develop my programming skills and create new tools.
</p>

<p>
  I'm interested in all areas of software development with a particular interest
  in web development. My University degree has given me a strong understanding of
  <strong>Object Orientated Programming</strong> using <strong>Java</strong> and
  exposed me to <strong>Functional Programming Languages</strong> such as
  <strong>Scheme</strong> and <strong>OCaml</strong>. Furthermore I have a firm
  grasp of fundamental Computer Science concepts such as algorithmic complexity,
  computability and data structures.
</p>

<p>
  In my free time I have delved into web development experimenting with
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> frameworks such as <strong>jQuery</strong>,
  <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Express</strong>.
  I've created
  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~awocallaghan" target="_blank">npm packages</a>
  contributing to the open source JavaScript community and familiarised myself
  with best practices and useful build tools such as <strong>Gulp</strong>,
  <strong>Grunt</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>, <strong>Browserify</strong>, etc.
  I've also used <strong>Cordova</strong> and
  <strong>Ionic</strong> to create a
  <a href="https://github.com/awocallaghan/todo-ionic" target="_blank">cross-platform smartphone application</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I have a strong understanding of <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>.
  I've used CSS preprocessors such as <strong>SASS</strong> and <strong>LESS</strong>
  and popular frameworks such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Foundation</strong>
  to create responsive websites. I've completed freelance web development work
  designing and implementing professional websites to clients' requirements.
  I've employed the iterative Agile software development methodology of conducting
  scrums and sprints to burn through the project backlog. Furthermore, I understand
  the importance of following <strong>Test Driven Development (TDD)</strong>
  and <strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong> to ensure a project
  meets all functional and user experience requirements.

<h3>FootyFeeds project</h3>

<p>
  I created a football news aggregator called
  <a href="http://footyfeeds.co.uk" target="_blank">FootyFeeds</a>
  to provide an effective and efficient method for football fans to get all the
  latest headlines relating to their team. I created the backend using a
  <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database to store the news data and an
  <strong>Express</strong> webserver to provide a <strong>RESTful API</strong>
  and to regularly gather news articles from <strong>RSS feeds</strong>.
  The frontend is an <strong>Angular</strong> single page application which
  allows users to register an account, filter news by their favourite team,
  and filter which RSS sources are displayed. The Angular app is open source and
  you can get the code on
  <a href="https://github.com/awocallaghan/footyfeeds-angular" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
  I also created social media accounts to help promote the website:
  <a href="https://twitter.com/footyfeeds" target="_blank">Twitter</a>,
  <a href="https://facebook.com/footyfeeds" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, and
  <a href="https://google.com/+footyfeedsnet" target="_blank">Google+</a>.
  I also used <strong>Google Analytics</strong> to track visitor activity and
  researched <strong>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</strong> techniques
  ensuring the address was registered with Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.

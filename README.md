Alex O'Callaghan personal website

My personal website/blog powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages built upon Start Bootstrap's [Clean Blog theme](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll).

See it live [here](http://alexocallaghan.com).

This site uses [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) to manage build tasks. Run `grunt` to build all assets, `grunt watch` to watch for changes.

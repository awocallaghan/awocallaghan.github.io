Alex O'Callaghan personal website
==

My personal website/blog powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) - see it live at [alexocallaghan.com](http://alexocallaghan.com).

Run locally
--

Clone the repository, run `bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve`, and visit `localhost:4000` in your browser.

Dev tasks
--

JavaScript assets are built using [Gulpjs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) - see `Gulpfile.js` and `Gulp.config.json`.

Install npm dev dependencies with `npm install`.

Build everything with `npm run build` and watch & build frontend assets with `npm run build:dev`.

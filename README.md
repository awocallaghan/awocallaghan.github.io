Dev tasks

This project originally used [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) to manage build tasks. Run `grunt` to build all assets, `grunt watch` to watch for changes. See `Gruntfile.js`.

Additionally [Gulpjs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) tasks have been recently added. See `Gulpfile.js`.
